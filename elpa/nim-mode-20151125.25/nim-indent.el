  "Get information about the current indentation context.
Context is returned in a cons with the form (STATUS . START).

STATUS can be one of the following:

keyword
-------

:after-comment
 - Point is after a comment line.
 - START is the position of the \"#\" character.
:inside-string
 - Point is inside string.
 - START is the position of the first quote that starts it.
:no-indent
 - No possible indentation case matches.
 - START is always zero.

:inside-paren
 - Fallback case when point is inside paren.
 - START is the first non space char position *after* the open paren.
:inside-paren-at-closing-nested-paren
 - Point is on a line that contains a nested paren closer.
 - START is the position of the open paren it closes.
:inside-paren-at-closing-paren
 - Point is on a line that contains a paren closer.
 - START is the position of the open paren.
:inside-paren-newline-start
 - Point is inside a paren with items starting in their own line.
 - START is the position of the open paren.
:inside-paren-newline-start-from-block
 - Point is inside a paren with items starting in their own line
   from a block start.
 - START is the position of the open paren.

:after-backslash
 - Fallback case when point is after backslash.
 - START is the char after the position of the backslash.
:after-backslash-assignment-continuation
 - Point is after a backslashed assignment.
 - START is the char after the position of the backslash.
:after-backslash-block-continuation
 - Point is after a backslashed block continuation.
 - START is the char after the position of the backslash.
:after-backslash-dotted-continuation
 - Point is after a backslashed dotted continuation.  Previous
   line must contain a dot to align with.
 - START is the char after the position of the backslash.
:after-backslash-first-line
 - First line following a backslashed continuation.
 - START is the char after the position of the backslash.

:after-block-end
 - Point is after a line containing a block ender.
 - START is the position where the ender starts.
:after-block-start
 - Point is after a line starting a block.
 - START is the position where the block starts.
:after-line
 - Point is after a simple line.
 - START is the position where the previous line starts.
