Dispatch agenda commands to collect entries to the agenda buffer.
Prompts for a command to execute.  Any prefix arg will be passed
on to the selected command.  The default selections are:

a     Call `org-agenda-list' to display the agenda for current day or week.
t     Call `org-todo-list' to display the global todo list.
T     Call `org-todo-list' to display the global todo list, select only
      entries with a specific TODO keyword (the user gets a prompt).
m     Call `org-tags-view' to display headlines with tags matching
      a condition  (the user is prompted for the condition).
M     Like `m', but select only TODO entries, no ordinary headlines.
L     Create a timeline for the current buffer.
e     Export views to associated files.
s     Search entries for keywords.
S     Search entries for keywords, only with TODO keywords.

More commands can be added by configuring the variable
`org-agenda-custom-commands'.  In particular, specific tags and TODO keyword
searches can be pre-defined in this way.

If the current buffer is in Org-mode and visiting a file, you can also
first press `<' once to indicate that the agenda should be temporarily
\(until the next use of \\[org-agenda]) restricted to the current file.
Pressing `<' twice means to restrict to the current subtree or region

(autoload 'org-search-view "org-agenda" "\
Show all entries that contain a phrase or words or regular expressions.

With optional prefix argument TODO-ONLY, only consider entries that are
TODO entries.  The argument STRING can be used to pass a default search
string into this function.  If EDIT-AT is non-nil, it means that the
user should get a chance to edit this string, with cursor at position
EDIT-AT.

The search string can be viewed either as a phrase that should be found as
is, or it can be broken into a number of snippets, each of which must match
in a Boolean way to select an entry.  The default depends on the variable
`org-agenda-search-view-always-boolean'.
Even if this is turned off (the default) you can always switch to
Boolean search dynamically by preceding the first word with  \"+\" or \"-\".

The default is a direct search of the whole phrase, where each space in
the search string can expand to an arbitrary amount of whitespace,
including newlines.

If using a Boolean search, the search string is split on whitespace and
each snippet is searched separately, with logical AND to select an entry.
Words prefixed with a minus must *not* occur in the entry.  Words without
a prefix or prefixed with a plus must occur in the entry.  Matching is
case-insensitive.  Words are enclosed by word delimiters (i.e. they must
match whole words, not parts of a word) if
`org-agenda-search-view-force-full-words' is set (default is nil).

Boolean search snippets enclosed by curly braces are interpreted as
regular expressions that must or (when preceded with \"-\") must not
match in the entry.  Snippets enclosed into double quotes will be taken
as a whole, to include whitespace.

- If the search string starts with an asterisk, search only in headlines.
- If (possibly after the leading star) the search string starts with an
  exclamation mark, this also means to look at TODO entries only, an effect
  that can also be achieved with a prefix argument.
- If (possibly after star and exclamation mark) the search string starts
  with a colon, this will mean that the (non-regexp) snippets of the
  Boolean search must match as full words.

This command searches the agenda files, and in addition the files listed
in `org-agenda-text-search-extra-files'.

Return diary information from org files.
This function can be used in a \"sexp\" diary entry in the Emacs calendar.
It accesses org files and extracts information from those files to be
listed in the diary.  The function accepts arguments specifying what
items should be listed.  For a list of arguments allowed here, see the
variable `org-agenda-entry-types'.

The call in the diary file should look like this:

   &%%(org-diary) ~/path/to/some/orgfile.org

Use a separate line for each org file to check.  Or, if you omit the file name,
all files listed in `org-agenda-files' will be checked automatically:

   &%%(org-diary)

If you don't give any arguments (as in the example above), the default
arguments (:deadline :scheduled :timestamp :sexp) are used.
So the example above may also be written as

   &%%(org-diary :deadline :timestamp :sexp :scheduled)

The function expects the lisp variables `entry' and `date' to be provided
by the caller, because this is how the calendar works.  Don't use this
function from a program - use `org-agenda-get-day-entries' instead.

Activate appointments found in `org-agenda-files'.

If FILTER is t, interactively prompt the user for a regular
expression, and filter out entries that don't match it.

If FILTER is a string, use this string as a regular expression
for filtering entries out.

If FILTER is a function, filter out entries against which
calling the function returns nil.  This function takes one
argument: an entry from `org-agenda-get-day-entries'.

FILTER can also be an alist with the car of each cell being
either 'headline or 'category.  For example:

  '((headline \"IMPORTANT\")
    (category \"Work\"))

will only add headlines containing IMPORTANT or headlines
belonging to the \"Work\" category.

ARGS are symbols indicating what kind of entries to consider.
By default `org-agenda-to-appt' will use :deadline, :scheduled
and :timestamp entries.  See the docstring of `org-diary' for
details and examples.

If an entry has a APPT_WARNTIME property, its value will be used
to override `appt-message-warning-time'.
