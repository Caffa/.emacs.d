;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package provides functionality for correcting words via custom
;; interfaces. There are two functions for this: `flyspell-correct-word-generic'
;; to correct word at point and `flyspell-correct-previous-word-generic' to
;; correct any visible word before point. In most cases second function is more
;; convenient, so don't forget to bind it.
;;
;; (define-key flyspell-mode-map (kbd "C-;") 'flyspell-correct-previous-word-generic)
;;
;; When invoked, it will show the list of corrections suggested by Flyspell.
;; Most interfaces also allow you to save new word to your dictionary, accept
;; this spelling in current buffer or for a whole session.
;;
;; Since this package does not provide any interface for correcting words, it's
;; better to use one of the following packages: `flyspell-correct-ivy',
;; `flyspell-correct-helm' and `flyspell-correct-popup'. The all depend on
;; `flyspell-correct' and just provide interface for it's functionality.
;;
;; But one can easily implement it's own interface for `flyspell-correct'.
;; Checkout documentation for `flyspell-correct-interface' variable.
;;
;; For more information about this and related package, please read attached
;; README.org file.
