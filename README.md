# Super quick start guide...

Assuming you have `git` installed...

In a terminal window, type:

    git clone https://github.com/ocodo/emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d

Now start Emacs - if you're running in a shell, (ie. iTerm2)
set the Terminal mode to `xterm-256color`, e.g.

    export TERM=xterm-256color

Ocodo's dot emacs directory might make Emacs a little less painful for
you than the defaults. 

This set up is primarily used on a Mac, with Emacs 24. (Cocoa emacs or
Emacs Mac Port work just fine)

Start Emacs
